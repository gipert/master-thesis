### Search for Lorentz and CPT symmetries violation in double-beta decay using data from the GERDA experiment ###

Needs `latekmk`, `pdflatex` and `lualatex`. Then just `make` to compile the project.

This thesis has been written with the [EB-garamond typeface](https://github.com/georgd/EB-Garamond), a manual installation of the types might be needed.

Parallel compilation with `make -jN` is supported.
